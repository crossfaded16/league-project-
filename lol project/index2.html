                            League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions
                            face off to destroy the other's base. Choose from over 156 champions to make epic plays,
                            secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.

                    Top lane has long been known as an island because of the combination of being a long lane, side
                    lane, and solo lane. It is the closest thing you can get to a pure 1v1 in a matchmade League of
                    Legends game. What follows is everything you need to know to jump in a game and hold your own on
                    that island.<br>
                    <br>
                    Top is a long lane and there is no ally champion to lane with. This means top laners are most often
                    tanks or high damage champions that can make use of the long lane to run down enemies. The 1v1
                    nature of top also means there are more champion options than any other role.<br>
                    <br>
                    While runes are champion specific, summoner spells on top laners are standard. Some split-pushers
                    will run Ignite for kill pressure, but almost every other top laner will run Flash and Teleport.
                    Teleport serves the dual purpose of allowing you to get back to lane faster after a recall or to
                    make a play on the map with your team.

                    Jungler is the most unique role in League of Legends. Instead of playing in lane, you traverse the map fighting neutral monsters and popping out to surprise your enemies. What follows is a guide to get you ready to light up the jungle in your next game.<br>
                    <br>
                    Junglers can fit many roles because they are often the wildcard of the team. You can almost always find a champion that can successfully clear the jungle for the role the team needs. That said, the most common jungler roles are carry and tank.<br>

                    Mid lane has been the most popular role since the inception of League of Legends. It is known for its high map impact and heavy damage playstyle. What follows is everything you need to know to start dominating your games as a mid laner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mages and assassins make up the majority of the mid lane champion pool. The short lane allows for mages to farm safely despite generally being limited in terms of mobility. Assassins are picked for their ability to quickly burst out enemy laners in the short lane. Both mages and assassins also thrive off roaming, making mid lane ideal for its central location on the map.<br>
                    <br>
                    Roaming is very impactful for a mid laner because it is the center lane on the map. You are always a threat to help out top or bot lane. Mid laners are also usually the closest to their jungler, and as such can make plays on the map together.

                    Bot lane is a role so important to success that they have a dedicated support champion to protect them in lane. Although often synonymous with AD carry, bot lane also allows for ranged mage carries as well. What follows is what you need to start crushing bot lane in your games.<br>
                    <br>
                    Marksmen are also better equipped to fight while under-leveled than tanks and mages. They are then placed in bot lane because the support lanes with them and it is the nearest lane to the first big objective, an elemental drake. Objectives are easier to do with more ally players in close proximity.<br>
                    <br>
                    Bot is a 2v2 lane, so you will need to keep track of auto attack ranges for two enemy champions. This is also true for enemy spells. The three pieces of information you must keep track of for spells are range, cooldown, and whether or not the spells pass through minions.

                    Supports are the guardians of the team. Behind every good carry, you’ll find a support who is enabling them to succeed. What follows is how to make the most of your games on support to guide your team to a win.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are two main categories of support champions: tanks and enchanters. Tanks are picked for support because of their engage. In this low economy role, tanks that have little or no crowd control are not viable because they cannot afford items to offset this weakness. <br>
                    <br>
                    Support tanks are expected to have just enough tankiness to get off their crowd control before going down in fights. Typically they will prioritize building items that help protect their carries, even if they give the support less.
